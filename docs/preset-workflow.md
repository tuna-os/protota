# Building app presets from official GNOME source

Presets are not hand-drawn: each one is **generated from the app's real
Blueprint/GtkBuilder (and Vala) source**, then **hand-finished** with a small,
reviewable set of overrides for state the source cannot settle statically.
This document is the full workflow — the same one CI, agents, and humans use.

```

## 1. Catalog entry

`tests/fixtures/gnome-app-catalog.json` is the machine-readable source of
truth. A source-importable app needs:

```jsonc
"calculator": {
  "sourceImport": {
    "repository": "https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calculator.git",
    "tag": "49.2",          // MUST match the native app version used for verification
    "importRoot": "src",    // directory walked for .blp/.ui/.vala files
    "entry": "math-window.blp"
  }
}
```

The tag pin matters: the visual oracle (the real app under Broadway) and the
imported source must be the same version, or you are comparing different UIs.

## 2. Generate

```sh
npx tsx scripts/import-gnome-app.mjs calculator          # one app
npx tsx scripts/import-gnome-app.mjs --all               # every catalogued app
npx tsx scripts/import-gnome-app.mjs calculator --refresh  # re-clone after a tag bump
```

This clones into `.gnome-source-cache/` (gitignored) and writes
`public/presets/<app>.mockup.json`. The importer resolves cross-file
templates, discovers code-built composites from Vala construction facts, and
keeps anything it cannot honestly render as a labelled `custom-widget`
boundary — never a fake approximation. The import report (diagnostics count)
is printed and embedded in the preset.

## 3. Hand-finishing

`presets-src/<app>.finishing.json` records every human decision, each with a
`why`. It can declare multiple screens (mode variants, dialogs) and flow
edges:

```jsonc
{
  "title": "GNOME Calculator",
  "screens": [
    { "id": "basic", "entry": "math-window.blp", "title": "Basic", "width": 360, "height": 460,
      "overrides": [
        { "id": "_converter", "set": { "visible": false },
          "why": "converter.set_visible(mode == CONVERSION); default mode is basic." }
      ] },
    { "id": "preferences", "entry": "math-preferences.blp", "title": "Preferences", "width": 460, "height": 420 }
  ],
  "edges": [ { "from": "basic", "to": "preferences", "why": "Main menu → Preferences" } ]
}
```

Rules of thumb:
- An override needs a `why` grounded in the app's source or observed runtime
  behaviour — not taste.
- Mode variants reuse the same entry and switch the visible stack page via
  `visibleChildName`.
- If GNOME renames a node id, generation **fails loudly** listing the stale
  overrides — that is the drift alarm working.
- Use the app's official appdata screenshots (`<image>` URLs in its
  metainfo) to decide which states deserve screens.

## 4. Visual review

```sh
npm run dev          # in one terminal
npx tsx scripts/capture-preset.mjs calculator      # writes artifacts/preset-calculator.png
```

Captures the whole canvas — all screens plus flow arrows — with editor
chrome hidden. Look at it. A passing test is not a review.

## 5. Broadway verification (pixel metrics vs the real app)

Run the app natively under Broadway and compare (see
`docs/gnome-app-conformance.md` for recorded results):

```sh
podman build -f containers/broadway/Dockerfile.fedora \
  --build-arg APP_PACKAGE=gnome-calculator --build-arg APP_COMMAND=gnome-calculator \
  -t broadway-app containers/broadway
podman run -d --rm -p 8085:8085 broadway-app
BROADWAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8085 BROADWAY_APP_ID=calculator BROADWAY_PRESET_ID=calculator \
  npx playwright test tests/broadway-reference.spec.ts
```

The Fedora runner covers GNOME versions newer than Ubuntu LTS. Artifacts
(native PNG, Protota PNG, diff, metrics JSON) land in `test-results/`.

## Fidelity report

Track accuracy over time instead of spot-checking. With the native app
serving Broadway (locally or through a tunnel):

```sh
npx tsx scripts/fidelity-report.mjs --broadway http://127.0.0.1:8085 weather
npx tsx scripts/fidelity-report.mjs --broadway http://127.0.0.1:8085 --screen basic calculator
```

It records difference ratio, source-resolved similarity, foreground IoU and
unresolved-boundary coverage into `artifacts/fidelity.json` and prints a
Markdown table. `--screen` picks which screen of a multi-screen preset
depicts the captured window. The tool measures; it does not launch
containers, so the same command works against podman locally or a remote
host.

Recorded 2026-07-30:

| App | Screen | Difference | Source-resolved |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| weather | first | 2.29% | 97.7% |
| calculator | basic | 9.59% | 90.3% |

## Export validation

"Design here, ship there" is only trustworthy if what this tool emits builds.
The upstream compiler is the authority, not our own parser:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/export-blueprint.mjs      # writes artifacts/blp/<app>-<screen>.blp
# then, in a container with blueprint-compiler installed:
for f in *.blp; do blueprint-compiler compile "$f" >/dev/null || echo "FAIL $f"; done
```

State as of 2026-07-30: **6 of 27** exported screens compile, up from 1. The
emitter had been producing camelCase property names, `top { }` blocks instead
of `[top]` annotations, quoted enums and object references, editor-only style
flags (`suggested: true`), and signal handlers as properties.

The remaining failures share one root cause worth fixing next: the importer
keeps a source class only for unresolved boundaries, so a widget mapped onto a
generic renderer type exports as that generic class and loses its real
properties. A `Gtk.Revealer` imported as `bin` exports as `Adw.Bin` with
`transition-type`, which the compiler rightly rejects. Retaining `sourceClass`
on every imported node and preferring it on export is the Phase 3 round-trip
work in `source-widget-architecture.md`.

Smaller categories: duplicate object IDs after template expansion, and
object-reference properties (`menu-model`) naming menus the export does not
carry.

## Building UIs programmatically (agents)

The same building blocks are a typed API — `src/utils/agent-api.ts`:

```ts
import { MockupBuilder } from './src/utils/agent-api';

const doc = new MockupBuilder('My App')
  .addScreen('standard', 'Main')
  .addWidget('toolbar-view').addWidget('header-bar', { title: 'My App' }).up()
  .addScreen('preferences', 'Preferences')
  .connectScreens('Main', 'Preferences')          // flow edge, drawn on canvas
  .build();

// Or start from real source / an existing preset:
const imported = new MockupBuilder('From Source')
  .importScreens(files, 'window.blp')             // full importer: templates, Vala facts, boundaries
  .overrideNode('sidebar', { visible: false })    // finishing-style override
  .build();
```

`MockupBuilder.fromDocument(doc)` continues from any existing document.
`validate()` checks child legality before you ship.

GNOME layout is slot-driven, so placement is part of adding a widget:

```ts
MockupBuilder.slotsFor(header-bar);   // [start, title, end]
MockupBuilder.childrenFor(list-box);  // widgets a boxed list accepts

builder.addWidget(button, { title: Open, slot: start });
```

A slot the container does not offer is rejected rather than silently placed
somewhere else. In the editor the same control is the Slot selector at the
top of the Inspector.

## In the editor (users)

- **Flows**: select anything in a screen — the Inspector shows the screen's
  flows with add/remove. The toolbar **Flows** button toggles the arrows.
- **Save JSON / Code Export / PNG**: toolbar buttons export the document, the
  generated Blueprint, or a screen image.
- Importing a `.blp`/`.ui` file via File → Import runs the same importer as
  the preset pipeline.
